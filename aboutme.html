            <p class="bio">I'm Nicholas Rose, a web designer from Vermont who specializes in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Aside from designing web pages, my passions are music (mainly guitar, piano and singing), hiking, gold panning, writing, weightlifting and most importantly, being a father to a wonderful daughter. I've lived in Vermont in the Burlington area for most of my life and continue to be creatively inspired by the people close to me, as well as by the scenery and environment that I've been fortunate enough to live in for the past thirty years.</p>
